#Creating-a-NewScraping-exe-

This directory contains codes showing data scraping from an online website, specifically a news paper website.
Here I extracted the xpath of the number 1 news website in Nigeria(Vanguard News) to make a simple .exe file that could be used to get news headlines for each day after being ran.

##Packages to be installed to replicated code:

-Selenium
