This directory contains codes showing data scraping from an online website, specifically a news paper website.
Here I extracted the xpath of the number 1 news website in Nigeria(Vanguard News) to make a simple .exe file that could be used to get news headlines for each day after being ran.

#Packages to be installed to replicated code:

-Selenium

-Chrome driver

-pandas

-pyinstaller

 To install exe file, go to the directory where Vanguard_Today.py is located
 open your terminal and input "pyinstaller --onefile Vanguard_Today.py"
 press enter and in a minutes your exe file will be created and be ready to be ran.
